# Airport Reliability Dashboard
Filter & Fly has had problems with airports and airlines constantly being delayed or cancelled. This leads to frustrations with their customers who demand a refund for their trip. They have tasked us with creating a dashboard to identify airport and airline risks in order to reduce customer frustration and avoid rebooking/refund costs.

## Key questions include:
* Which airlines have the lowest likelihood of delay, and which airports are consistently most on-time?
* How do delay rates and average delay minutes change by season or month?
* What are the most common causes (carrier, weather, airport) for specific airline–airport combinations?
* Correlation with airlines and airports?
* Ranking reliability on the dashboard (low risk or high risk filters)?
* Risk by state/location and by season?

* Using these insights, the agency can recommend lower-risk routes, suggest better departure seasons, and flag high-risk itineraries that may need extra buffer time or backup options. To clarify, **we are not forecasting** but providing information to help the travel agency make informed business decisions.
