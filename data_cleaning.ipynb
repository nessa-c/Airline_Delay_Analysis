    "# Airport Reliability Dashboard\n",
    "Filter & Fly has had problems with airports and airlines constantly being delayed or cancelled. This leads to frustrations with their customers who demand a refund for their trip. They have tasked us with creating a dashboard to identify airport and airline risks in order to reduce customer frustration and avoid rebooking/refund costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key questions include:\n",
    "* Which airlines have the lowest likelihood of delay, and which airports are consistently most on-time?\n",
    "* How do delay rates and average delay minutes change by season or month?\n",
    "* What are the most common causes (carrier, weather, airport) for specific airline–airport combinations?\n",
    "* Correlation with airlines and airports?\n",
    "* Ranking reliability on the dashboard (low risk or high risk filters)?\n",
    "* Risk by state/location and by season?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using these insights, the agency can recommend lower-risk routes, suggest better departure seasons, and flag high-risk itineraries that may need extra buffer time or backup options. To clarify, **we are not forecasting** but providing information to help the travel agency make informed business decisions."
